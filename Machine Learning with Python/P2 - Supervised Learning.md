# Supervised Learning
1. Input
    - labelled data
2. Process
    - identify patterns and methods
    - learn from them
3. Output
    - predictions
4. Test
    - operator who knows correct predictions
    - checks and score the output from ML model
5. Repeat
    - repeat 1-4
    - until algo achieves the highest accuracy


### Supervised Learning Algos:
- linear and logistic regressions
- multi-class classification
- decision trees
- support vector machines

### Example - Fire incident detection
Training data
- model includes
    - area spead of fire
    - smoke levels
    - temperature
    - rate of increase of spread
    - outcome labelled as fire incident or not
- the model used to on other types of fires:
    - camp fire
    - cooking fire


### Types of Supervised Learning Algos:
- Classification
- Regression

**Classification**:
- attach one of the 2 categories to input data
- example
    - Spam or not (Email)


**Regression**:
- establishes relationship between input and output variable
- used when output variable is either
    - real value, or
    - continuous value
- example
    - forecast the value of stock market
